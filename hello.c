#include <stdio.h>
/*added this comment and learning syntax for c is strange. i guess i got spoiled by pyhons user friendliness
the #include is what imports the module, and the module stdio.h is what containts the "printf: function. */

int main(void)
/* the line above is what starts the program.... somehow... look, im new to this, and the lecture hasnt explained how this but works, aight?*/
{
    printf("Hello, World! \n");
}
